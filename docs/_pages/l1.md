### Prologue

By now, it should be obvious to everyone that the information revolution has and will continue to dominate or at least influence significant aspects of our life, probably for the entirety of humanities future. To express this in a less abstract fashion: Computers are everywhere, whether you like it or not.

Computers appear and, indeed, often are needlessly complicated. The most important aspect of understanding how computers work is gaining the skills needed to communicate with them.

In this course we will be learning how to communicate with computers using the programming language Rust. The language is generally considered to have a steep learning curve for newcomers. However, this assumes that the newcomer is already a programmer with plenty of experience in other languages. As an example, German appears to be a difficult language to master from the perspective of an English speaker, but nonetheless it is being successfully taught to German children. Following this analogy, I believe Rust should be as easy to learn as any other language for complete beginners.

In the same way that cultural immersion is necessary for the mastery of a human language, it is helpful to immersive yourself in the language, community and projects surrounding Rust.

This is what Rust looks like:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("How do I look?");
}
```

### Post Scriptum: Setting up the Environment for this Course

- Cargo
- Atom / VS Code

### Exercises

1. Convert the integer 2020 to a binary representation.
2. Convert the hexadecimal value 0x539 to a decimal representation.
2. Create and run an empty project using cargo. (_Hint: [Cargo Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/first-steps.html)_)
